## Background and Objectives

- Validate one more time your understanding of methods and variables.
- Learn how to use string concatenation and interpolation.
- Understand the difference between **single** and **double** quotes.

## Specs

### Compute name

- Implement the `compute_name` method defined in the `lib/compute_name.rb` file. Given the three arguments, it should return the concatenation of the `first_name`, `middle_name` and `last_name`.
- **constraint**: You must use **string interpolation** with `#{}`.

### Interactive Program

The `lib/interface.rb` file contains a program to interact with a user. Try it now with:

```
$ ruby lib/interface.rb
```

Then, assuming you have entered "Boris" then "Alexandre" and finally "Papillard", the program should print a custom message like `"Hello, Boris Alexandre Papillard !"`.

* **constraint**: to build the `custom_message` string, you must use string concatenation this time, with the `+` operator.
* **enhancement**: your `custom_message` could also Ã¬nform you about the number of characters in your name (for instance, "Boris Alexandre Papillard" has got 24 characters, including spaces), or other very important details...

## Learning Badges

Again, ask yourself these questions and make sure you can answer all of them:

### on variable
* What are the variables in my code ?
* Where do I assign values to these variables and where do I use them ?
* The 3 variables `first_name`, `middle_name`, and `last_name` are only defined in the `#name_from_terminal` method. Are they available outside this method ?
* What's the scope of a variable ?

### on methods
* What are the methods in my program ? Where do I define them ?
* Where do I call them and with which arguments ?
* What's the flow of my program when I try to read it line by line ?

### on strings
* What's string interpolation ? What's the syntax to "include" some ruby expression in a string ?
* What's the difference between single-quotes `''` or double-quotes `""` when using string interpolation ?
