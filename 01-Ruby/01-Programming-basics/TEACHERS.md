## Guidelines

## Morning lecture

1. **BUILT-IN OBJECTS**: spend some time (but not too much) on the slides. Then switch on IRB to live-code some examples (try to make it interactive and ask questions to the students)
1. **HOW TO RUN YOUR CODE?**: Here is the main message to give: IRB is the playground to make experiments, your ruby file is your source code! So play with IRB and then write your solution in your file, not the other way around. Show how to launch IRB (you have just used it before), how to quit it, and explain its outputs. Then show how to run a ruby script from the terminal and how to display results with `puts`. Make them understand that a ruby program can run without printing things on a terminal and that `puts` is just a usefull method as the terminal is our only interface at the moment (you can tease them & say that it will be a web page later on!)
1. **VARIABLES**: **Spend time on this**. Go to the white board to use the "shoes box" metaphora. A variable is like a **named** shoes box containing a value. Take your time on assignment and re-assignment coding few examples on a ruby file. Ask them questions to ensure they get it! Hammer on the fact that a **variable is not a string**, it has no `""`!
1. **METHODS**: Again **go slowly**, and live-code different examples to ensure they  really understand the difference between defining and calling a method, and the difference between parameters and arguments ! Also spend time on the notion of **return**. Make them understand that a method is like a black box or a factory. It **eats** values in input (the arguments)

## Day challenges
Before starting the challenges, ensure every student has a clean git status, and that he has pulled upstream, in case the challenges have been changed by the teachers. Otherwise students may work on old versions of the challenges :)

## Live-code

## Git sanity-check
At the end of the day, ensure every `git status` is clean in the class !
