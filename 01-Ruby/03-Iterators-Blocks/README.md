## Roadmap of the day


- normalement pas 10 lignes par méthode .. trouver le bon choix
- 2nd plus costaud
- 2 d’apres => améliorer la lisibilité == refacto (réfléchir a ce que la personne a fait)

#### `01-Enumerable`

- The important challenge of the day. It may take you nearly all morning.
- The idea is a bit the same as your first challenge "Experiment methods". **Here you have to find the right iterator to perform some treatment on an array, and learn how this iterator works**, each one is different. If each of your methods has 10 lines of code, that means there's something wrong!

#### `02-About-blocks`

A difficult challenge where you have to code a method using a block that generates HTML strings. Don't panic with the syntax of the method we give you with the default argument `tag(tag_name, attr = nil)`. Read all the challenge to understand what this syntax means (it's not complicated).


#### `03-Beautify-my-code` and `04-Cleaning-your-mess`
The first challenge is here to teach you that **readibility** matters. Try to make your code **readable** to others. Pick good names for your variables, use intermediate variables when it makes your code more understandable. The second challenge is here to make you refactor some bad code (inherited from a poor developper). Enhance it, DRY it, make it readable and beautiful!


#### `05-Louchebem`
Code a Louchebem translator (it's an French slang). Go step-by-step, start simply with a word translator. And then try to handle longer texts and enhance your translator.
