### Roadmap of the day

#### Set-up
Before starting the challenges, ensure you have a clean git status and that you have pulled upstream. Otherwise you may work on old versions of the challenges.

```
$ cd ~/code/${GITHUB_USERNAME}/promo-4-challenges/
$ git status #everything should be ok!
$ git pull --no-edit upstream master
```

Ensure you're connected on Slack.
