## Guidelines

### Morning lecture

### Day challenges

Before starting the challenges

- Ensure every student has a clean git status, and that he has pulled upstream. Otherwise students may work on old versions of the challenges :).

```
$ cd ~/code/${GITHUB_USERNAME}/promo-4-challenges/
$ git status #everything should be ok!
$ git pull --no-edit upstream master
```

- Ensure they're connected on the class Slack

- Make a brief overview of the roadmap of the day with them, explaining the general idea behind each challenge.

### Live-code

#### General guidelines
- The live-code should be made **from scratch**. No specs, no boilerplate. The student has to `mkdir` a new folder, `touch` its ruby file, and start coding in it. Help him on the setup. Make him code **a solution that works** in one ruby file before refactoring the code (separating the logic from the interface in 2 files, DRYing the repetitive code chunks, etc..)

- Announce, **before the live-code**, which challenges they are going to live-code and who are the coders of the day. It will make them stay tensed and focused! Tell them they have to speak loud and explain their approach while they are live-coding. That's the best exercise to improve their skills!

- At the end of the live-code, ensure every `git status` is clean in the class! To make the work of your buddy-teacher easier tomorrow :)
