### `01-middleman-content-migration`

The objective of this challenge is to migrate your poor HTML website into a nice Middleman project with templates and SASS. Start with a fork/clone of our [middleman boilerplate](https://github.com/lewagon/middleman-boilerplate)

### `02-middleman-style-migration`

In this challenge, you will adopt a very clean organization of our styleheets, and you will use SASS variables, chaining and nesting to have a concise but efficient design.

### `03-middleman-local-data`

Add a new page to your site connected to a text-database of your choice. Once you know this technique, you can easily add new content and maintain your website.

### `04-building-sass-modules`

This challenge makes you write your first SASS modules. Once written, you can re-use them in all your future projects. That rocks!
